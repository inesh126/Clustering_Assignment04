Clustering Using Scikit-Learn
This project demonstrates the application of various clustering algorithms using Scikit-Learn. It provides insights into how different algorithms perform on synthetic datasets and real-world data, emphasizing visualization and evaluation techniques.

📁 Project Overview
The notebook explores the following clustering algorithms:

K-Means Clustering

Mean Shift Clustering

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

Agglomerative Clustering

Each algorithm is applied to different datasets to showcase their strengths and limitations.

📊 Datasets Used
Synthetic Datasets:

Blobs: Generated using make_blobs to create isotropic Gaussian blobs for clustering.

Moons: Generated using make_moons to create two interleaving half circles.

Real-World Dataset:

Customer Data: Loaded from a CSV file containing customer information, including features relevant for clustering and a 'CHURNRISK' label for evaluation.

🛠️ Technologies and Libraries
Python 3.x

Scikit-Learn: Machine learning library for implementing clustering algorithms.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Numerical computing.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.

Plotly: Interactive visualizations.

📌 Key Features
Algorithm Implementation: Step-by-step application of clustering algorithms with parameter tuning.

Visualization: 2D and 3D plots to visualize clustering results and understand algorithm behavior.

Evaluation: External evaluation using known labels (e.g., 'CHURNRISK') to assess clustering performance.

Interactive Elements: Use of Plotly for interactive 3D scatter plots, enhancing data exploration.

📈 Results and Observations
K-Means: Performs well on spherical clusters (e.g., blobs) but struggles with non-convex shapes (e.g., moons).

Mean Shift: Automatically determines the number of clusters but can be computationally intensive.

DBSCAN: Effective in identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noise but sensitive to parameter settings.

Agglomerative Clustering: Builds a hierarchy of clusters and can capture complex cluster structures.
